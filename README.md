# Final Project

This repository contains the R Markdown analysis for my final project. It includes a `Makefile` to streamline running the analysis, and separate folders for code and outputs.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   **final_project_2.Rmd**: The main R Markdown file for the analysis.
-   **Makefile**: Automates the process of running the analysis and generating the output.
-   **code/**: Contains any supporting R scripts or functions used in the analysis.
-   **output/**: Stores the results and generated files from the analysis.
